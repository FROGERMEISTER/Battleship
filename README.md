# Battleship

Battleship:
Has to be run in editor on a dedicated server for 2 players

- Left click to place ship
- Right click to rotate ship
- E to change ship
- Spacebar to remove ship
- R to ready up

- Left click to shoot once game has started

Ships will disappear after the first turn because of a bug in my programming
